This is a standalone OCaml program to emit a Koinly compatible csv document for
a Mina ledger address.

This is largely inspired by the [[https://github.com/garethtdavies/mina-taxes][backend code]] for https://export.minaexplorer.com/.

* Example

#+begin_src sh
  dune exec ./bin/main.exe -- -addr <B62my_mina_address>
#+end_src
