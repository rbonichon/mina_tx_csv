This is a standalone OCaml program to emit a Koinly compatible csv document for
a Mina ledger address.

This is largely inspired by the [[https://github.com/garethtdavies/mina-taxes][backend code]] for https://export.minaexplorer.com/.

* Example

Assuming you retrieve the data from a live node, the following command suffices.

#+begin_src sh
  dune exec ./bin/main.exe -- -addr <B62my_mina_address>
#+end_src

Or, if you already have downloade a JSON file that has the transactions you want to export:

#+begin_src sh
 dune exec ./bin/main.exe -- -addr <B62my_mina_address> transactions.json          
#+end_src
